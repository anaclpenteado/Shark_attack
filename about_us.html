<h1>About Us</h1>
<div class="otter">
<p>Our company's main goal is to help protect marine life and clear the ocean of our pollution.
We want creatures like these to live a happy life.
</p>
At Shark Attack, we are passionate about protecting marine life and safeguarding the world’s oceans through 
grassroots action. Founded on the belief that lasting change happens when communities unite, our organization is 
rooted in volunteer work, empowering individuals to become active stewards of the sea. From restoring coral reefs 
and organizing beach clean-ups to raising awareness about endangered species, we offer hands-on opportunities for 
people of all backgrounds to contribute meaningfully.
<br>
We are more than just an environmental group—we are a movement of changemakers dedicated to preserving the delicate 
balance of marine ecosystems. Our volunteers are the heart of everything we do, playing a vital role in cleaning coastlines, 
reducing pollution, and promoting sustainable living within their communities.
</br>
<br>
At Shark Attack, we invite you to join us on this journey. Whether you have a few hours to spare or are looking for long-term 
involvement, there is always a way to dive in and make a difference. Together, we can create a cleaner, healthier ocean and a 
brighter future for all marine life.

        <div class=Camron_text>Camron-I helped start this company to protect aquatic life because our oceans, rivers,
            and
            lakes are under
            the constant threat from pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction. Aquatic ecosystems play a
            crucial
            role in maintaining biodiversity, supporting countless species, and sustaining human life through clean
            water and food sources. By focusing on initiatives to safeguard marine environments, reduce pollution,
            and
            promote sustainable practices, I aim to make a positive impact on the planet and ensure that future
            generations can experience the beauty and benefits of healthy aquatic ecosystems.

    <div class=Ana_text>Ana-I helped start this company to protect aquatic life because of the growing urgency to
        preserve
        our waters
        and marine species. Aquatic ecosystems are essential to global biodiversity and play a critical role in
        regulating our climate, supporting food chains, and sustaining countless species—including humans. I’m
        motivated by the potential to make a tangible difference, from cleaning up pollution to implementing
        sustainable practices that can help balance marine habitats. My goal is to create a ripple effect of
        positive impact, inspiring others to join in safeguarding these irreplaceable ecosystems for the health of
        our planet and future generations.

    <div class=Riley_text>Riley-I helped start this company to save aquatic life out of a deep commitment to
        protecting the world’s oceans and freshwater habitats. Every day, marine ecosystems face immense threats from pollution,
        overfishing, and climate change, putting countless species at risk. By creating a company dedicated to
        conservation, I aim to address these challenges through targeted actions that restore habitats, reduce human
        impact, and raise awareness. My vision is to foster a world where marine life can thrive alongside human
        activity, ensuring that our oceans and waterways remain vibrant, resilient, and full of life for generations
        to come.
